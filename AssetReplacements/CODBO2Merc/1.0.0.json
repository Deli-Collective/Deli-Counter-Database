  "Description": "Bring out the nostalgia goggles, it's go time. This is the Call of Duty - Black Ops 2 Announcer for team Mercs, whether it's the greatest in-game announcer Activision has ever made or not? Debatable. But I liked it so much I wanted to bring it to H3VR. The voicelines and titlecard all belong to Activision (C'mon I'm just a weeb, if you wanted to hear my voice find my Walter or Warden TNH Announcers)",
