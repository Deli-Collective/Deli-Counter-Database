  "Description": "Replaces the wimpy bolt release sound with a more realistic and satisfying metallic click.\nGives the suppressed shots for all Intermediate and most Fullpower cartridges a little more 'oomph' and 'pop'.\nAdds realistic ARMA style supersonic cracks when a bullet whizzes by. (To disable, remove the BetterSoundsBullets.hotmod file)\nThis is a work in progress, let me know what other sounds could be improved/replaced.",
  "ShortDescription": "More realistic bolt release, supressed shots, and bullet whixx sounds",
