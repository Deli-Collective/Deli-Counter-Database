  "Description": "One of my oldest mods, somehow never made it to Bonetome! I present: RigSounds! This replaces just about all sounds related to drawing and placing mags into quickbelt slots and is meant to give the feel of using a tactical rig with pouches and velcro galore.\nZiiiiip!\nNote: This replaces the magazine grabbing noise, so keep those mags spawnlocked and use that mag release button!\nInstallation: Just drag and drop into your mods folder!",
