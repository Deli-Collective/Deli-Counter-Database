  "Description": "You ever wanted to be just like John Wick? Well, you can't. No one is THAT good. BUT, you can totally LARP as John Wick with this new TNH character: John Wurst!!! \nJohn Wurst's weapon pools ONLY include guns that John Wick has used in the movies. When you buy a gun from the supply room, it will come kitted out exactly like it was in the movie when John used it.\nAdditionally, custom sosigs have been created to mirror the kinds of enemies that John faces in the three movies. Early sosigs, for example, will be unarmored and have pistols only. But beware the final holds when the High Table enforcers kick in the door.",
