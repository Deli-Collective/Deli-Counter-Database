  "Description": "Promeatheus is a sci-fi themed Take and Hold map. It is an indoor map that features a mix of short and long hallways, small and medium sized holds/supply points, and shiny floors.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\nI recommend turning off HDR and Bloom. I tuned the lighting to look good with HDR off. Also the map still looks good even on the Low setting.\r\n\r\nStory(?):\r\nWhy is the Weinerland-Umami Corporation guarding this abandoned science vessel? Your mission is to investigate the Promeatheus and recover any valuable information you can.",
