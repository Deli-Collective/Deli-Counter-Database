  "VersionNumber": "1.3.8",
  "Description": "Updated and improved with a new account! \r\nIt is my pleasure to bring you Meat's Magazines! I have knocked out dozens of magazines I wanted to see most in H3, and conveniently found all the assets...elsewhere online...\r\n\r\nThis update to Meat's Magazines adds literally another dozen or more magazines, I lost count honestly. That means more menus, more rounds, more fun!Now extended magazines have their own menu alongside miscellaneous magazines which I will continue to dump mags into as I make them.\r\n\r\nAll are found at the end of the Assault Rifles tab.\r\n\r\nThanks Tarky developers for your models and textures kthxbyee",
