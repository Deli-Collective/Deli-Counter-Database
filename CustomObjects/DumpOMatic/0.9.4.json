  "Description": "The Dump-o-matic is the pinnacle of abusive consumerism!\nThis handgun holds up 8 rounds of 9mm Parabellum, with how poorly it is made, it would be surprising if it could fire one more...\nIt is spawnlockable, so once empty, spawn a new one, rack it and off you go!\nEven empty, this is deadly ! Your character throws this gun 2.5x times harder than any other guns and deals 2x the melee damage\nThere is also a golden unlimited ammo version, just for giggles",
