PAINTSTAKINGLY MADE TO BE ACCURATE AND THE BEST KILLING POWER AROUND.\r\n\r\nTHE SHOTGUN, THE GOOD OLD CLASSIC, FIRES 12 GAUGE AND HOLDS 20 ROUND DRUM, ITS SMALL FRAME IS VERY HANDY FOR CQC ENVIRONMENTS. IT ALSO COMES WITH A HOLOSIGHT FOR MAXIMUM AIMING POWER.\r\n\r\nTHE MACHINEGUN, CULT CLASSIC, HIGH RATE OF FIRE, FIRING 10MMAUTO. 40 ROUND STICK MAG WITH ADDED AMMO COUNTER BUILT INTO THE GUN. YOU KNOW THIS GUN WELL ENOUGH TO NOT NEED EXPLANATION.\r\n\r\nTHE RAILGUN, A LONG DISTANCE FRIEND. FIRES .35 MOSES AT EITHER A 5 ROUND BATTERY OR A 20 ROUND BATTERY, ITS HUGE BULLPUP FRAME MAKES IT AWKWARD TO USE IN CQC ENVIRONMENTS, SO TAKE NOTE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS BEFORE DIVING INTO THE GOREFEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE GUNS WILL CREATE SO MUCH BLOODSHED EVEN YOUR PC WILL BLEED. ORDER NOW \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the previous version having bugs.\r\nIf theres more bugs, find me on the homebrew discord or the main discord and tell me what broke.",
