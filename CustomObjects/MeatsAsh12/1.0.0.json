  "Description": "This \"High Caliber Assault Submachine Gun\", which sounds like a child's nonsensical description is actually the Russian description of this prototype CQB firearm. Actually chambered in 12.7x55mm, this version is chambered for 45. 70 Govt as a substitute until custom ammo becomes doable. Similar in Kinetic Energy, this gun will slap around some sosigs.\r\n\r\nFound in the Assault Rifle Category, with 10, 20 round mags and an oversized muzzlebrake. I recommend the UZI suppressor as it is ludicrous in length.",
