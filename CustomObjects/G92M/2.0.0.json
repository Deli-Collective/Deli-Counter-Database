  "Name": "\"Golub\" 92 Match (G92M)",
  "Description": "After a week of bugs, fixes and more bugs, the Golub 92 Match is completed. \r\n- Fitted with a USP Match weight, the slide from a Beretta M9, and a Glock 18's frame.\r\n- Chambered in .45 ACP\r\n- Comes with a scrap version\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Purple Edition seen in the video and images didn't get into the final mod - partly because I wanted to keep it for myself, being the greedy tosspot that I am. Ok COMPLETELY because I'm a greedy tosspot.\r\n\r\nIf enough people ask I might make some non-match versions and more realistic variations using the H3VR model's textures so the gun looks more cobbled together. You can ask on discord at SovietPigeon#7650\r\n\r\nAnyways, have fun.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FEATURES - \r\nSlide release button",
