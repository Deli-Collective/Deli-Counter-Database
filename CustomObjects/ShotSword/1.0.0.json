This mod appears to not work with some people, I'm trying to fix this but this takes me some time as I don't own the headsets where the problem occurs, sorry.\r\n\r\nThis is a quite dangerous sword, but also a deadly shotgun!\r\nLoad this weapon with Dragon's Breath ammo and unleash terror among sliced and grilled sosigs!\r\n\r\nThe weapon is in \"Shotguns > Tube Fed\"\r\nIt holds 3 rounds in the internal mag plus one in the chamber\r\nIt features a \"Hidden\" attachment point on the top for stuff like a laser pointer",
