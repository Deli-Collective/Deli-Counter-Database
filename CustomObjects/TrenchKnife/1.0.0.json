  "Description": "Hello everyone! This is my first custom weapon, the M1918 US Trench Knife! Special thanks to Potato and Meat_Banana for helping me through the process of making this. Currently, the scale is not 100% correct because I was lazy so instead I scaled it relative to the brass knuckles. The knuckle part of the knife has a damage vector but does slash damage instead of blunt damage.\r\nI'll be fixing those things eventually but for now this will have to do.\r\nPlease give feedback and let me know what you think!\r\nModel made by DakotaKimble on Sketchfab\r\n",
