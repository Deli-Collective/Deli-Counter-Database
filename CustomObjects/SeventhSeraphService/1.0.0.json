  "VersionNumber": "1.0.0",
  "Description": "First gun I've made so it was a good learning experience.\n\nLots of work to do still on it, including getting the sights working. For now, there's an invisible rail on top and I highly recommend you use it. \n\nIt accepts .357 magnum and if you want to use a speedloader there is one under the Unica6. It might look like the bullets won't line up with the loader but thanks to Anton that's not a problem. The chambers are supposed to look wonky, no need for concern. \n\nLet me know if you find anything!\n\nIntall by extracting the files to your VirtualObjects folder.",
