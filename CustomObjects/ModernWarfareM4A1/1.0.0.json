  "Description": "\"We get dirty and the world stays clean.\"\r\n\r\nThe Modern Warfare M4A1!\r\n\r\nThe iconic Assault Rifle from media all over appears in its Modern Warfare flesh!\r\nFirst time doing a weapon for H3VR, so there are a couple minor issues, but all of them are just things that I would love to just touch up in the future (Literally Unplayable). Nothing that would effect gameplay or immersion!\r\n\r\nHuge shoutout to the H3VR Homebrew Discord, they helped me a bunch!\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nModels/Sounds - Infinity Ward",
